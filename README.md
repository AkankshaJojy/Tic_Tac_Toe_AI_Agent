# Tic_Tac_Toe_AI_Agent

This project implements an AI agent to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning, to ensure that it is unbeatable. This project is a great way to understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

Features

Unbeatable AI:
The AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible moves.
Alpha-Beta Pruning is implemented to optimize the Minimax algorithm by eliminating unnecessary branches.


Human vs AI Gameplay:
Allows a human player to compete against the AI.
Provides a graphical interface for easy interaction.


Game Logic:
Implements all rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Checks for win conditions, draw conditions, and invalid moves.
